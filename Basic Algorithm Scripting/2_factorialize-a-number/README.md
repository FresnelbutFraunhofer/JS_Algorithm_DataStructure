Return the factorial of the provided integer.
<br>
If the integer is represented with the letter `n`, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation `n!`

For example: `5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.
